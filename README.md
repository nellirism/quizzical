## Description

The Quizzical Quiz Master application is designed to validate your fundamental knowledge of JavaScript. It is a timer-based quiz application that contains five (5) questions presented in no particular order and stores high scores at the client-side. Each question provides multiple choice of answers. When you choose to begin the quiz, a timer will display as questions are asked with multiple choice of answers. 

If the user answers correctly, the user will gain point and the next question will be asked. If the user chose the wrong answer, an n amount of time is subtracted from the timer. Once the quiz finishes, a score will be displayed and the user will be prompted to enter his initials. The user will be given an option to play again or end the game completely. He will also be given an option to view High Scores.
